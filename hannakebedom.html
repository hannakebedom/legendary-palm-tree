<h2>About Me</h2>
<p1>I am a full-time, first year student enrolled in the Honours Bachelor of Commerce/Juris Doctor   Program at the University of Ottawa. When I am not studying, I work part-time as a Parliamentary Page  at the House of Commons.</p1>
<p2>Through my commerce degree, I discovered my interest in the intersection between commerce and computer science. I will be transferring to the Honours Bachelor of Computer Science program at Carleton University as of September 2020 to pursue this path.</p2>

<h2>Commerce + Computer Science </h2>
<p3>The application of computer science to commerce can be powerful. When studying commerce at the  University of Ottawa, I fell in love with financial technology. To think that software systems can be used to provide financial services amazes me. In the future, using my love for both fields, I hope to work to create applications that revolutionize how financial services are delivered. Shopify is an excellent example of how technology can revolutionize commerce. Through Shopify, thousands of merchants have the opportunity to sell their products online to a diverse audience. </p3>
